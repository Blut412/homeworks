				<h2 id="section-01" class="dish-1">Classic Ukrainian Beef Borsch</h2>
				<div class="dish-1">
					<p class="dish-1">
						The most iconic and famous dish in this collection of Ukrainian dinner
						recipes! Classic beef borsch is made with tender chunks of beef, loads of
						beets, onions, carrot, cabbage and fresh dill. This hearty and warming
						soup
						is the ultimate comfort food. Enjoy it with sour cream or mayonnaise,
						paired with toasted bread.

				<h2 id="section-02" class="dish-2">Ukrainian Braised Pork with Gravy</h2>
				<div class="dish-2">
					<p class="dish-2">
						Tender, fall-apart pork slow braised with a hearty mushroom gravy and
						served over creamy mashed potatoes. Pork is the most popular meat choice
						in Ukraine and can be found in many recipes. This incredible braised pork
						is extra hearty and delicious for any day of the week. Plus, you can
						prepare the pork using a slow cooker, too.

				<h2 id="section-03" class="dish-3">Easy Chicken Plov (Rice Pilaf)</h2>
				<div class="dish-3">
					<p class="dish-3">
						One of my favorite childhood dishes – my mom’s easy chicken plov! This
						delicious chicken rice dish is quick and easy to make and so flavorful!
						Plov is a traditional Uzbek dish, usually made with beef or lamb, but this
						Ukrainian chicken version is also incredible!

				<h2 id="section-04" class="dish-4">Turkey & Rice Cabbage Rolls</h2>
				<div class="dish-4">
					<p class="dish-4">
						The most delicious and easy turkey cabbage rolls recipe! These Ukrainian
						cabbage rolls are filled with a juicy meat, rice and carrot mixture, then
						baked in a carrot, onion and tomato sauce. The rolls come out extra juicy,
						aromatic and very flavorful. Known as ‘holuptsi’ in Ukraine, these are a
						childhood favorite of mine!

						My grandmother would make these for us at least once a week! We loved
						coming over to her house across the street from us to get ourselves some
						cabbage piroshki! My grandmother had gone through so much in her life
						(including concentration camp) but she never let her hard life bring down
						her bright and loving energy! These piroshki are so incredibly delicious!

					<p class="dish-7">
						Hearty and delicious stuffed peppers filled with a combination of seasoned
						meat and rice. The peppers are cooked in the oven in a delicious

						peppers are easier to make then stuffed cabbage rolls and just as
						delicious!
